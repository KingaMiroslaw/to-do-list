# About The App

The project was created while attending the [JavaScript - Jedyny Kurs, Kt√≥rego Potrzebujesz](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-jedyny-kurs-ktorego-potrzebujesz/) created by Mateusz Maj. The project was created to practice the basic JavaScript functionalities presented in the course.

It is a simple application that allows users to create a list of activities that need to be done. Along with the ability to add activities, edit, delete and mark them as completed.


Features:
- Add action to the list
- Remove the action from the list
- Edit an action from the list
- Mark the action as complete
